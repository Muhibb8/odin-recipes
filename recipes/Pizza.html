  <h3>
    Pepperoni pizza is an American pizza variety which includes one of the country's most beloved toppings. Pepperoni is actually a corrupted form of peperoni (one “p”), which denotes a large pepper in Italian, but nowadays it denotes a spicy salami, usually made with a mixture of beef, pork, and spices.

   <h2>Steps</h2>

   <h3><ol>

    <li>For Sauce
        <p>Combine all sauce ingredients with 1/2 cup water in a medium bowl; set aside for flavors to develop while making crust. Freeze remaining paste .</p>
    </li>
    <li>For crust
        <p>Combine 2 cups of flour with the dry yeast, sugar and salt. Add the water and oil and mix until well blended (about 1 minute). Gradually add enough remaining flour slowly, until a soft, sticky dough ball is formed.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Knead for about 4 minutes, on a floured surface, until dough is smooth and elastic. Add more flour, if needed. (If using RapidRise® Yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.)

    </li>
    <li><p>Divide dough in half. Pat each half (with floured hands) into a 12-inch greased pizza pan OR roll dough to fit pans.
          </p>
    </li>
    <li>For pizzas
        <p> Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Top crusts with sauce, pepperoni and cheese.</p>

    </li>
    <li>
        Bake for 18 to 20 minutes until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly. For best results, rotate pizza pans between top and bottom oven racks halfway through baking.
