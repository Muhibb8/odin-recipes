    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <h3><ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325Â°F. Lightly spray an 8x8 baking dish (not a 9x9 dish or your brownies will overcook) with cooking spray and line it with parchment paper. Spray the parchment paper.</li>

        <li><p>In a medium bowl, combine the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, powdered sugar, chocolate chips, and salt.
        </p></li>

        <li><p>In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, water, and vanilla.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Sprinkle the dry mix over the wet mix and stir until just combined.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Pour the batter into the prepared pan (it'll be thick - that's ok) and use a spatula to smooth the top. Bake for 40 to 48 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out with only a few crumbs attached (note: it's better to pull the brownies out early than to leave them in too long). Cool completely before slicing.*** Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. These also freeze well!
        </p></li>
